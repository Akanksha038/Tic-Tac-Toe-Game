# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game


## Introduction
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a classic two-player game implemented using modern web technologies. The objective of this project is to create a simple, interactive, and fun game that demonstrates my skills in front-end development. This project also serves as a practice for implementing game logic, managing state, and creating a responsive user interface.
